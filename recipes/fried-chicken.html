        <h2>How to make Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>And here's how to make it : </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate chicken overnight in buttermilk brine – this salts the flesh all the way through and makes it beautifully tender and juicy (also gives you room for error in cook time);
            </li>
            <li>Drizzle some brine in the seasoned flour and rub in to make lumps = extra nubbly craggy bits on crust. Secret trick that makes the crust so epic!
            </li>
            <li>Coat chicken in flour then fry until golden.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How long does it take chicken to fry?</h2>
        <p>Thighs and drumsticks take 8 minutes, or until the internal temperature in centre of thickest part is 75°C / 167°F. Breast takes around 7 minutes (internal temperature at thickest part 65°C / 150°F).</p>
        <h2>Reusing the oil</h2>
        <p>Typically, oil used for deep frying can be reused 3 times or so once it’s been cleaned. However, I find that for Fried Chicken, it’s usually only good for one more batch of Fried Chicken or similarly flavoured food. I think the oil just gets too tainted by the heavily flavoured breading and while the oil can be cleaned of all the bits in it, you can’t remove the flavour.

            To remove impurities, I find the best and easiest way is a Cook’s Illustrated method using a cornflour/cornstarch and water method, cooked in the oil over low heat until it solidifies and captures all the impurities. Strain the cornflour “jelly”, then store the oil for another use. (PS Using a fine strainer isn’t good enough to filter the oil after this recipe, you’d need to use a coffee filter or similar which takes ages. But for other fried recipes like Honey Chicken and Sweet & Sour Pork, straining is fine).</p>
        
        <h2>What to serve with Fried Chicken</h2>
        <p>For the full homemade KFC experience, serve it with Coleslaw*, chips, KFC copycat potato and gravy.

            For a Southern meal, add a side of steamed or grilled corn, cornbread, Slaw, Potato Salad and Southern Baked Beans. Enjoy your friend chicken!</p>
