        <p>Honey Garlic Chicken Breast is a flavorful dish featuring tender chicken breast cooked to golden perfection, 
            then coated in a rich, sweet-savory sauce made from honey, minced garlic, soy sauce, and a touch of vinegar. 
            The taste is perfectly balanced—sweet, salty, and slightly tangy—making it ideal to pair with steamed rice or vegetables. 
            A simple yet satisfying choice for lunch or dinner..</p>
            
        <p>BONUS: This can be made with any protein – beef, pork, lamb, shrimp/prawns, even tofu!</p>
    
        <h2>What you need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>of course a chicken</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>vinegar</li>
            <li>honey</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li>butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to make Honey Garlic Chicken Breast</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Split chicken breast in half – so 2 breasts makes 4 pieces;</li>
            <li>Dust chicken with flour (gives the chicken a slight crust so the sauce clings to it better!)</li>
            <li>Sear chicken, add butter, garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, honey.</li>
            <li>Simmer until the sauce thickens. Turn chicken to coat in the amazing honey garlic sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>and that's its!</p>
        <p>Notice how the sauce is clinging to the surface? That’s because we dusted the chicken with flour so when it’s pan fried, it creates a crust.</p>
        <h2>What to serve with Honey Garlic Chicken Breast</h2>
        <p>There’s enough sauce to drizzle over veggies and soak into rice or whatever you serve it with. The flavour is strong enough such that you don’t need loads – a bit goes a long way!

            It’s pictured above with Cauliflower Rice (tossed with a squeeze of lemon, parsley, salt and pepper) with Cucumber Salad on the side.
            
            Even though it’s got soy sauce in the Honey Garlic Sauce, this doesn’t taste specifically Asian-y. But it’s versatile enough that it will go just as well with Fried Rice as it will with a Macaroni Salad or even Mac and Cheese. Yes really! Try it once and you’ll understand (it only takes 12 minutes, you’ve got the time!!) </p>
